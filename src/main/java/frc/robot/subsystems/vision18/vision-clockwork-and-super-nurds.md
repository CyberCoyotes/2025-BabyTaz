This implementation provides:
1. Robust vision processing with validation
2. Distance-based measurement confidence
3. Clean integration with CTRE swerve
4. Comprehensive logging
5. Basic AprilTag alignment capability
6. LED control and pipeline switching

Key features:
- Validates measurements based on multiple criteria (distance, ambiguity, latency)
- Scales confidence based on distance to tags
- Only accepts vision updates when robot motion is stable
- Provides alignment capabilities for scoring/docking
- Extensive telemetry for debugging

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or provide additional implementation examples?
