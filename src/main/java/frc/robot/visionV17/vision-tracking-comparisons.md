Key Differences:

Architecture:


Mechanical Advantage takes a more comprehensive approach with separate commands for following vs reaching for tags
They handle both 2D (driving) and 3D (arm manipulation) tag tracking
Clockwork focuses more on vision integration with swerve odometry and includes detailed telemetry


Vision Processing:


Mechanical Advantage:

Uses ambiguity filtering to improve tag detection reliability
Handles multiple camera views with coordinate transforms
More robust handling of tag persistence and filtering
Built-in support for demo/test tags


Clockwork:

Tightly integrated with swerve drive kinematics
Focuses on odometry fusion
Uses time-stamped vision updates
Simpler single-camera implementation




Movement Control:


Mechanical Advantage:

Smooth trajectory-based movement using TrapezoidProfile
Separate commands for different behaviors (follow vs reach)
Built-in safety limits and checks


Clockwork:

Direct swerve drive control
Uses field-relative speeds and poses
Focus on accurate positioning over smooth movement



Recommendations:

For a mid-level team focusing on reliability:


Start with Clockwork's simpler vision integration approach
Add key elements from Mechanical Advantage like:

Ambiguity filtering
Vision update timestamping
Basic safety checks




Consider implementing:

javaCopy// Basic tag tracking with safety
public class SimpleTagTracker {
    private final SwerveDrive drivetrain;
    private final LimelightHelper limelight;
    
    // Minimum confidence threshold
    private static final double CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.80;
    
    // Safety limits
    private static final double MAX_APPROACH_SPEED = 0.5; // meters/sec
    private static final double MIN_TARGET_DISTANCE = 1.0; // meters
    
    public boolean alignToTag(int targetId) {
        if (!limelight.hasTarget() || limelight.getTagID() != targetId) {
            return false;
        }

        // Get basic tag info
        double tx = limelight.getTargetXAngle();
        double distance = limelight.getTargetDistance();
        
        // Safety check
        if (distance < MIN_TARGET_DISTANCE) {
            drivetrain.stop();
            return false; 
        }

        // Basic proportional control
        double rotationSpeed = -tx * 0.03; // Tune this constant
        double forwardSpeed = (distance - MIN_TARGET_DISTANCE) * 0.5;
        forwardSpeed = Math.min(forwardSpeed, MAX_APPROACH_SPEED);

        // Apply movement
        drivetrain.drive(forwardSpeed, 0, rotationSpeed, true);
        return true;
    }
}

Future Enhancements:


Add vision-odometry fusion
Implement basic trajectory following
Add multiple camera support
Include telemetry/logging

This provides a good starting point that can be expanded as your team's capabilities grow. The code is simpler than both reference implementations but includes important safety features and basic functionality that can be built upon.
Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail or provide additional example code for specific functionality?
